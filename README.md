# The Cookie Factory Lab Project
Welcome to the Cookie Factory Application! This repostiory is a design patterns project that I've worked on with [Trent Adamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trent-adamson-6a8351293/) & [Grant Fisco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantfiscocs/) during my sophomore year at the Milwaukee School of Engineering!

## Lab Instructions
Welcome to the Cookie Factory Program! The goal of creating this program is to demonstrate the advantage of the factory pattern. This is a GUI program where different types of cookies are created by a factory and then transported by different forms of transportation to cookie stores. 

## Program Guide
1. **Create Factories**: Use the drop-down menu to create factories that will produce your cookies.
2. **Unlock Transportation**: Once your costs fall below $1000, press the right key to unlock transportation options.
3. **Create Transportation**: You can create various modes of transportation, such as planes, boats, or trucks, to transport 
your cookies.
4. **Cookies Being Transported**: After setting up transportation, press the right key to see your cookies 
being transported back and forth.
5. **Selling**: As your cookies are sold, you will see your money decrease.
6. **Losses**: Occasionally, cookies go bad! Each type of store has a loss indicator to track this.
7. **Budgeting**: You start with a fixed amount of money. After building your factories, you'll earn extra money.
8. **Limits**: The number at the very top indicates how many cookies each store can buy, you will see that decrement 
as the factories produce the cookies!
